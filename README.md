  1.How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
This course was set up in a way that the design process was laid out for us. First and design was selected. Then the design was broken into simple shapes. This allows for an easy starting place as any kind of graphics was a foreign concept to me when starting. After the simple shapes were identified they were used to create basic 2d objects. Then the 2d objects are built into 3d objects. Then camera movement, texture, and lighting was added. This approach will be helpful when working on future applications. Start by planning out a design, creating a main function, then adding additional functions. 
    2. How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
I used the same development strategies as I usually do in my course work. I start with studying the end goal and breaking it into small sections that can be completed. It is simplified during course work because the projects are already broken down into sections for us. I have found it important to know what the next section will bring. That way you can be thinking about how that will work with the section that is currently being worked on. 
  3.How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
This course was based on learning how to create graphics but I found that it was great at seeing more of what c++ is able to do. Having to bounce around from language to language means seeing small glimpses of what the language is good at doing but this course showed just how universal c++ is. I do know know if I will every need to create graphics, however I know that the work in c++ I did during this course will absolutely help me if I ever get to use C++ in the professional world.
